// can be executed, or both of them. The values are calculated in such a way
// that transactions from at least count() ledgers are available in txhistory
// table.
//
// If mApplyBuckets is true, this catchup requires downloading and applying
// buckets for the getBucketApplyLedger() (which is equal to
// mApplyLedgers.mFirst - 1).
//
// Then all ledgers in range mApplyLedgers are downloaded and applied.

// buckets.
//
// First thing it does is to get a history state which allows to calculate
// proper destination ledger (in case CatchupConfiguration::CURRENT) was used
// and to get list of buckets that should be in database on that ledger.
//
// Next step is downloading and verifying ledgers (if verifyMode is set to
// VERIFY_BUFFERED_LEDGERS it can also verify against ledgers currently
// buffered in LedgerManager).
//
// Then, depending on configuration, it can download, verify and apply buckets
// (as in MINIMAL and RECENT catchups), and then download and apply
// transactions (as in COMPLETE and RECENT catchups).
//
// After that, catchup is done and node can replay buffered ledgers and take
// part in consensus protocol.
